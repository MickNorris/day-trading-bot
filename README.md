# day-trading-bot


Given the circumstances brought on by Covid-19 I've been really bored. I've since taken an interest in cryptocurrency in general, but more specifically exchanges (and more more specifically, day trading). Using Python and the Coinbase API I am attempting to make a day trading bought that will slowly but surely make a profit. 


I'm still very new to day trading so I'm spending a lot of my time watching the markets to look for patterns. Once I find patterns I hope to write code to take advantage of these trends.
